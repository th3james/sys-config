# Code style preferences
## North-Stars
- **Casey Muratori's focus on simple, fast code:** Emphasizes low-nonsense, efficient, and straightforward implementations.
- **Gary Bernhardt's Functional Core, Imperative Shell:** Separate pure, functional logic from imperative, stateful code.
- **TigerBeetle's "Tiger Style" style guide:** Incorporate the principles outlined in TigerBeetle's style guide, focusing on clarity, consistency, and rigorous attention to detail as detailed in their documentation.
- **Mike Acton's Data-Oriented Programming:** Advocates for structuring data for optimal memory and performance, offering suggestions to align with this paradigm.
- **Rich Hickey's Simple Made Easy:** Prefer simple constructs over complex abstractions.

## General
- Lindy-Test dependencies: Dependencies are a source of fragility. Prefer stable, battle-tested dependencies where they must be used.
- Avoid superflous commenting. Comments should add context which could not be obviously inferred by reading the code.
